# PawsPlaceDemo2025

Welcome to PawsPlace!  
We started this project as pet owners who struggled to find pet-friendly places to rent in London. Our goal: bring together pet owners and pet-friendly landlords to make the process easier and less stressful for everyone.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## 🐾 Project Structure

- `/src` – React source code
- `/public/logo.png` – Your site logo (replace with your own!)
- `/README.md` – This guide

## 🌟 Next Steps

- Edit `src/App.jsx` to update your welcome message or add features.
- Replace `public/logo.png` with your real logo.

## 📦 Build for production
